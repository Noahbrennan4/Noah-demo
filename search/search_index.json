The internet, according to Bory, is not a technology that is independent of social, political, and economic influences. He explains how ideologies and power structures influence the internet in ways that can either reinforce or disrupt existing hierarchies and injustices. Additionally, Bory contends that the emergence of networked individualism, which prioritises interpersonal relationships and social networking over fostering a sense of community and teamwork, is a result of the internet's emphasis on individualism and self-expression.
