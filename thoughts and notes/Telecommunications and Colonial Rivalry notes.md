# Summary and key notes
This text examines the role of telecommunications in European colonialism and rivalry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The article focuses on the construction of telegraph cables to the Canary Islands and Northwest Africa, which played a key role in connecting Europe to its colonies and trading partners in Africa and the Americas. The article discusses the political and economic motivations behind the construction of these cables, including the desire to assert European dominance over the region and to facilitate the growth of international trade. The article also explores the technological challenges involved in laying the cables, as well as the social and cultural impact of the telegraph on the region. 

# My thoughts
I noticed that the article concludes by noting that the telegraph was a key tool of European colonialism, facilitating communication and control over distant territories and peoples, and perpetuating systems of economic exploitation and political domination.
