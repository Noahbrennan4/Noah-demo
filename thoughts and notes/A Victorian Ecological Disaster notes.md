# Summary and key notes
This text discusses the environmental impact of the telegraph industry in the 19th century. The telegraph revolutionized communication, but it relied on a substance called gutta-percha, which was harvested from the sap of trees in Southeast Asia. The high demand for gutta-percha led to extensive deforestation and environmental degradation in the region. Wenzlhuemer argues that this ecological disaster was a direct result of imperialist expansion and capitalist exploitation, as Western powers exploited the resources of the Global South for their own economic gain.

# My thoughts
I noticed the article highlights need to consider the environmental and social consequences of technological advancements, particularly those that rely on finite resources and have a significant impact on ecosystems and communities.
