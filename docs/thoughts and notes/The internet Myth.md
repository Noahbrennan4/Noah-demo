# key notes and takeaways 

-   Chapter 2 focuses on the development of the internet and how it was perceived in the 1990s.
-   The author argues that during this time, the internet was viewed as a utopian space where individuals could connect with one another and overcome traditional power structures.
-   This perception of the internet was influenced by a number of factors, including the development of new technologies, the growth of online communities, and the rise of the hacker culture.
-   The author also discusses the concept of the "digital commons," which refers to the idea that the internet was a shared space that belonged to everyone.
-   However, the author notes that this view of the internet as a utopian space was not entirely accurate. While the internet did provide opportunities for new forms of communication and collaboration, it also replicated existing power structures and was subject to its own forms of inequality.
-   The author argues that the internet was never truly a "commons" because it was always subject to corporate interests and government regulation.
-   The chapter concludes by arguing that while the internet may not have lived up to its utopian ideals, it is still an important space for political and social activism, and that its potential as a tool for social change should not be underestimated.

My thoughts:
The growth of the internet from a military communication tool to a vast worldwide network of networked computers is covered in this chapter by Bory. He contends that although the internet has come to be seen as a symbol of liberty, democracy, and technological advancement, this mythical notion is not wholly true. The internet, according to Bory, is not a technology that is independent of social, political, and economic influences. He explains how ideologies and power structures influence the internet in ways that can either reinforce or disrupt existing hierarchies and injustices. Additionally, Bory contends that the emergence of networked individualism, which prioritises interpersonal relationships and social networking over fostering a sense of community and teamwork, is a result of the internet's emphasis on individualism and self-expression. He contends that this individualism has made it more challenging to address systemic issues and has contributed to the deterioration of conventional forms of social and political organisation.
