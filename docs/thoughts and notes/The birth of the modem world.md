## Key notes and takeaways 
-   The article explores the history of modems, which are devices that allow computers to communicate over telephone lines.
-   The first modem was invented in the late 1950s by a man named Ralph Wyckoff, who was trying to find a way to send computer data over long distances.
-   In the 1960s and 1970s, modems became increasingly popular among computer hobbyists, who used them to connect with each other and share information.
-   One early online community that emerged from this era was called the "CBBS," or "Computerized Bulletin Board System," which allowed users to post messages and files for others to download.
-   As the internet grew in popularity in the 1990s, modems became less necessary for accessing online content, as people could connect to the internet directly through their computers or through dedicated networking devices.
-   However, modems remained important for certain uses, such as connecting to remote servers or accessing online services through telephone lines.
-   Today, modems continue to be used in various forms, such as cable modems and DSL modems, which allow people to connect to the internet through their cable or phone lines.
-   Overall, the article highlights the important role that modems have played in the development of online communities and the internet as a whole, and how they have evolved over time to meet changing technological needs.
