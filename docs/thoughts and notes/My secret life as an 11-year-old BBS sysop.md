## My thoughts

The article tells the story of an 11-year-old boy who becomes a sysop (system operator) for a Bulletin Board System (BBS) in the 1990s. The author describes how he learned to code, set up the BBS, and became responsible for moderating the forum and maintaining the server. The author also explains how he kept his BBS hobby a secret from his parents and friends, and how he eventually had to shut down the BBS due to legal concerns. One interesting aspect of the article is the author's description of how the BBS was a space where people could connect and share information before the internet became mainstream. The author notes that the BBS community was relatively small and tight-knit, and that it was a space where people could be anonymous and express themselves freely. This aspect of the BBS culture may have been one of the reasons why the author was drawn to it, and it is a reminder of how the internet has changed over time. Another interesting aspect of the article is the author's discussion of the legal concerns surrounding BBSs in the 1990s. The author notes that BBSs were considered a potential threat to intellectual property rights, and that sysops could be held legally responsible for any illegal activities that took place on their servers. This is an important reminder of how the legal landscape surrounding the internet has evolved over time, and how concerns around online privacy and security have become more pronounced in recent years.
