## My goals at the beginning of this course: 
To expand my knowledge in computing and the history of the internet.


## Did I reach my goal?:  
Yes, I for sure reched my goal in this course as I didn't know what to excpect coming in however it was a very pleasent suprise. My knowledge with Obsedian and  github was zero so when I found out that all of our assignements we're going to be through them I got a little woried however the instruction taught in class made it very easy to catch along. For the first memex it was a little bit of a strugle but by the end of the semester I can say I am very comfordible with memex and Obsidian and I hope to use these applications in the future.

## Where could have I improved?:
I feel like this I learned alot of things this course but I could have improved on numerous things aswell. For starters my notetaking habbits werent the best. Being present during lectures or discussions, paying attention and participating in the topic, and taking notes that are succinct, organised, and simple to review later are all crucial for improving note-taking skills.  Additionally, reviewing and revising my notes right away after class could  have helped me retain the material and see any points that could need more explanation or study. I should have enhanced my capacity to record and retain vital information by using these suggestions and creating my own note-taking approach.


## Intersting things I learnt:
I wasn't aware that telegraphs and telephone infrastructure were both involved in the conception and development of the internet. The link was not as obvious before as it is today, though. I can now understand how the colonialized borders these discoveries are pulled from and how even the patent disputes that took place over these technologies had very comparable occurrences.
This is demonstrated by the progression of my memex, which begins with a message on colonialism and ends with the invention of modern computing.

## Conclusion :
Here are my thoughts after participating in this course that exposed me to cutting-edge software and hardware like GitHub and Obsidian. Despite early reservations, I was able to improve my skills throughout the course of the semester utilising these applications. I acknowledge, however, that I could have done better in some areas, particularly with regard to my note-taking practises. I also share newly learned information regarding the development of technology, particularly the relationship between telegraphs, telephone networks, and the internet. Overall, I believe that I have succeeded in completing the course and have gained insightful knowledge and practical skills that I want to use going forward in my studies.
